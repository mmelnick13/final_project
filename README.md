# Final Project

## Presentation
### Selected topic and Rationale:
Our team bonded over our fascination with true crime. We started chatting about the Gabby Petito case that was ongoing over the course of this project. We also mentioned how we had seen what appeared to be an increase in headlines on crime in Chicago. Based on these two discussions we thought it would be interesting to see what is going on with crime in Illinois.  

### Description of the source of the data:
The data was garnered from the Federal Bureau of Investigation Crime Data Explorere (CDE). The CDE provides select datasets for download. Incident-based data by state, summary data estimates, and data about other specific topics may be downloaded in CSV files from the selections below. Data are also available via the Crime Data API, a read-only web service that returns JSON or CSV data, and provides experienced users access to large amounts of UCR data to use and share. 2019 Illinois crime data provided us with more than 6K crime records amassing over 150K data components. At first glance, we see that Illinois rate of violent crime offenses by population were increasing and much higher than the general U.S. population.


### Questions hope to anwser with the data:
1. In which season do the most crimes happen in IL?
2. In the season with the most crimes, are they more violent or nonviolent offenses?

### Description of the data exploration of the project:
- Ade to do. Rubric says the following must have been done - might be nice to hit on those parts:
✓ Database stores static data for use during the project ✓ Database interfaces with the project in some format (e.g., scraping updates the
database, or database connects to the model) ✓ Includes at least two tables (or collections, if using MongoDB) ✓ Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in
Pandas) ✓ Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo)


### Description of the analysis phase of the project:
- Jess to do. Rubric says to include the following:
✓ Description of data preprocessing ✓ Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including the team's
decision-making process ✓ Description of how data was split into training and testing sets ✓ Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits ✓ Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the
Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables) ✓ Description of how model was trained (or retrained, if they are using an existing
model) ✓ Description and explanation of model’s confusion matrix, including final accuracy
score
Additionally, the model obviously addresses the question or problem the team is
solving.
