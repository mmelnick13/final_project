# Final Project

## Presentation
### Selected topic and Rationale:
Our team bonded over our fascination with true crime. We started chatting about the Gabby Petito case that was ongoing over the course of this project. We also mentioned how we had seen what appeared to be an increase in headlines on crime in Chicago. Based on these two discussions we thought it would be interesting to see what is going on with crime in Illinois.  

### Description of the source of the data:
The data was garnered from the Federal Bureau of Investigation Crime Data Explorere (CDE). The CDE provides select datasets for download. Incident-based data by state, summary data estimates, and data about other specific topics may be downloaded in CSV files from the selections below. Data are also available via the Crime Data API, a read-only web service that returns JSON or CSV data, and provides experienced users access to large amounts of UCR data to use and share. 2019 Illinois crime data provided us with more than 6K crime records amassing over 150K data components. At first glance, we see that Illinois rate of violent crime offenses by population were increasing and much higher than the general U.S. population.


### Questions hope to anwser with the data:
1. In which season do the most crimes happen in IL?
2. In the season with the most crimes, are they more violent or nonviolent offenses?
