# Final Project

## Presentation
### Selected topic:
Our team bonded over our fascination with true crime. We started chatting about the Gabby Petito case that was ongoing over the course of this project. We also mentioned how we had seen what appeared to be an increase in headlines on crime in Chicago. Based on these two discussions we thought it would be interesting to see what is going on with crime in Illinois.  

- Reason why they selected their topic:
Curious to see the crime rate in Chicago with the increase in mentions in the news.

- Description of their source of the data:
The data was garnered from the Federal Bureau of Investigation Crime Data Explorere (CDE). The CDE provides select datasets for download. Incident-based data by state, summary data estimates, and data about other specific topics may be downloaded in CSV files from the selections below. Data are also available via the Crime Data API, a read-only web service that returns JSON or CSV data, and provides experienced users access to large amounts of UCR data to use and share.

- Questions they hope to anwser with the data:
Looking to predict the season based on the crime
